Objective: Design an intuitive real-time voice session interface for sales training
Requirements: Real-time feedback, minimal cognitive load, professional appearance

📌 CREATIVE PHASE START: Voice Session Interface Design
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ PROBLEM
   Description: Design a real-time voice session interface that allows users to practice sales conversations with AI while maintaining situational awareness
   Requirements: 
   - Real-time audio streaming with < 300ms latency
   - Live transcription display without distraction
   - Clear session timer and minute balance visibility
   - Intuitive microphone controls and connection status
   - Professional appearance suitable for sales professionals
   - Mobile-friendly responsive design
   Constraints: 
   - Must work across all modern browsers
   - Cannot interfere with audio streaming performance
   - Limited screen real estate on mobile devices
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)

2️⃣ OPTIONS
   Option A: Split-Screen Layout - Dedicated panels for controls and transcript
   Option B: Overlay Interface - Floating controls over minimal background
   Option C: Bottom-Sheet Design - Controls at bottom, transcript fills screen
   Option D: Sidebar Layout - Fixed sidebar with controls, main area for transcript

3️⃣ ANALYSIS
   | Criterion | Split-Screen | Overlay | Bottom-Sheet | Sidebar |
   |-----------|--------------|---------|-------------|---------|
   | Usability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Mobile UX | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
   | Visual Clarity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Implementation | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   
   Key Insights:
   - Split-screen works well on desktop but cramped on mobile
   - Overlay risks interfering with transcript readability
   - Bottom-sheet provides familiar mobile UX pattern
   - Sidebar traditional but may not optimize transcript space

4️⃣ DECISION
   Selected: Option C: Bottom-Sheet Design with Adaptive Layout
   Rationale: Best mobile experience while maintaining desktop usability, follows familiar design patterns, maximizes transcript visibility

5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   - Use CSS Grid for responsive layout adaptation
   - Implement collapsible bottom sheet for more transcript space
   - Add swipe gestures for mobile sheet manipulation
   - Use WebSocket connection status indicators in sheet header
   - Implement audio visualizer in microphone button
   - Add haptic feedback for mobile touch interactions
   - Include keyboard shortcuts for desktop power users (spacebar to mute/unmute)
